## Category
The best enhancement to the Sitecore Admin (XP) for Content Editors & Marketers

## Description

Sitecore is storage of data. I even know companies, who use Sitecore only as "advanced" database. Very often stored data is homogeneous. But Sitecore doesn' have any interface for editing this type of data. 

We introduce intgration of Data Grid to Sitecore Content Editor that will allow Content Managers to edit bulk data more quickly and efficiently.
